Hello everyone! Less than a year ago I was a program director managing to keep a hundred and then some scholars happy after surviving an 8:00am to 2:00pm schedule only to remain in school for an additional 3 hours while their parents work or fulfill other tasks. After school programs, especially in New York City is imperative for all parents and often a need for financially strained parents in low income communities. Over the past five years of working in youth development, I have noticed a rise in the demand for after school programs but a lacking of technological advancement in this sector to provide high quality programs and to keep up with this rising demand. Moreover, COVID-19 has further exposed the need for technical intervention in this low funded sector. Through such integration, applying for after school and maintaining relationships and partnerships between parents and guardians and after school teams can be more easily achieved. For these reasons I have decided to study software engineering to gain the necessary skills that will allow me to contribute to bridging the gap between inadequate after school strategies and the modern student.
